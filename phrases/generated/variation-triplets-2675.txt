my watch fell in the water
my watch fell out of my pocket
my watch fell in my lap
my watch fell in front of my face
prevailing wind from the east
prevailing wind from the United States
prevailing wind from the coast of Florida
prevailing wind from the rest of the region
never too rich and never too thin
never too rich to take care of themselves
