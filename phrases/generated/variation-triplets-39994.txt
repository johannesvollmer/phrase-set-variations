my watch fell in the water
my watch fell on my face
my watch fell out of my pocket
my watch fell to the ground
prevailing wind from the east
prevailing wind from the United States
prevailing wind from a number of different directions
prevailing wind from our country
never too rich and never too thin
never too rich and never too poor
