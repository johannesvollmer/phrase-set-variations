my watch fell out of my pocket
my watch fell in front of me
my watch fell out of my hand
prevailing wind from the east
prevailing wind from high wind speeds
prevailing wind from hitting the coast
prevailing wind from the Cascades
never too rich and never too thin
never too rich and never too poor
never too rich and never too poor to live
never too rich and not too poor
I can see the rings on Saturn
I can see the appeal in this one
I can see the other side of it
I can see the problem
physics and chemistry are hard
physics and chemistry
physics and chemistry, and related fields
