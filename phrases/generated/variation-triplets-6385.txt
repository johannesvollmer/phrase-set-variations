my watch fell in the water
my watch fell out
my watch fell to the bottom of the shelf
my watch fell into my hand
prevailing wind from the east
prevailing wind from the west
prevailing wind from the south
prevailing wind from the North Sea
never too rich and never too thin
never too rich and a little nervous
never too rich and never too poor
never too rich and famous
I can see the rings on Saturn
