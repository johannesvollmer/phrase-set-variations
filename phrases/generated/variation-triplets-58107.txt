my watch fell in the water
my watch fell to the ground
my watch fell to the floor
my watch fell from my wrist
prevailing wind from the east
prevailing wind from the north-west
prevailing wind from the south-east
prevailing wind from the north
never too rich and never too thin
never too rich and not too poor
never too rich and never too poor
